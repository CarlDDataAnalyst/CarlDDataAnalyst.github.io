                    <h3 class="major">About the project</h3>
                    <p>This project consists of two main dashboards: The <strong>Requisition Report</strong> and the <strong>Candidates Report</strong>.</p>

                    <p>The <strong>Requisition Report</strong> provides a breakdown of job requisitions by their current status and average approval times across different regions.</p>
                    <p>The <strong>Candidates Report</strong> offers insights into the candidate pipeline, including key recruitment metrics, applicant activity trends, average number of openings per requisition, and the number of candidates per status.</p>
                    <p>These dashboards serve as a powerful tool for tracking and analyzing recruitment metrics, aiding in data-driven decision-making in the recruitment process.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>The dashboard is divided into two main sections:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Key Metrics</strong>: On the left side, there are four panels displaying key metrics related to job requisitions:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Total Applicants</strong>: This metric shows the total number of applicants for all requisitions.</li>
                                <li><strong>Total Requisitions</strong>: This represents the total number of job requisitions.</li>
                                <li><strong>Average CVs Submitted</strong>: This indicates the average number of CVs submitted per requisition.</li>
                                <li><strong>Unique Requisitions</strong>: This shows the number of unique job requisitions.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Trends and Analysis</strong>: On the right side, there are three line graphs providing a temporal view of applicant activity:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Active Applicants</strong>: This graph shows the trend of active applicants over time.</li>
                                <li><strong>Total Applicants (Active Requisitions)</strong>: This graph displays the total number of applicants for active requisitions over time.</li>
                                <li><strong>Rejected Applicants</strong>: This graph illustrates the trend of rejected applicants over time.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Each of these line graphs is accompanied by a bar graph below it, providing a more detailed breakdown of the data by region (e.g., Asia Pacific, Middle East & Africa, etc.).</p>
                    <p>This dashboard is a powerful tool for tracking and analyzing recruitment metrics. It allows for quick visualization of trends in applicant activity and rejection rates across different regions, which can be invaluable for making data-driven decisions in the recruitment process. As a data analyst, you could highlight how this dashboard can help identify bottlenecks in the hiring process, optimize resource allocation, and ultimately improve the efficiency and effectiveness of recruitment efforts.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Pie Chart</strong>: On the left side of the dashboard, there’s a pie chart that represents various requisition statuses. These include “Approved,” “Cancelled,” “Open - Cancelled,” “Open - Filled,” “Open - Not Filled,” and “Open - Withdrawn.” Each status is represented by a different color and is associated with a number and percentage out of the total 929 current total requisitions.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Total Requisitions</strong>: On the right side of the pie chart, the total number of current requisitions is prominently displayed as 929.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Bar Graph</strong>: Next to the total requisitions, there’s a vertical bar graph displaying counts for each status category. The bars are color-coded to match those in the pie chart.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>This dashboard provides a clear and concise view of the current status of all requisitions, making it easy to understand the distribution of different statuses at a glance. It would be particularly useful for tracking the progress of requisitions and identifying any potential bottlenecks or areas for improvement in the requisition process.</p>
